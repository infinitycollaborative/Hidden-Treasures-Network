🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS
Before Starting Each Phase:
✅ Read the entire prompt first
✅ Check pre-build validation checklist
✅ Ensure previous phases are stable
✅ Have test data ready
✅ Plan deployment timing
During Build:
✅ Follow validation checks in code
✅ Test each feature as it's built
✅ Don't skip the test suites
✅ Review security rules carefully
✅ Document any customizations
After Build:
✅ Run complete test suite
✅ Test on multiple devices/browsers
✅ Load test with realistic data
✅ Review security one more time
✅ Deploy to staging first, then production

💡 PRO TIPS
Tip 1: Start Small
Don't try to build all 24 phases at once. Build Tier 1, launch, get feedback, iterate, then move to Tier 2.
Tip 2: Use Real Data
Test with actual student data (with permission), not fake data. Real data reveals real issues.
Tip 3: Get Feedback Early
Show Phase 13 to students immediately. Their excitement (or lack thereof) tells you everything.
Tip 4: Celebrate Milestones
Each phase completion is a huge achievement. Celebrate with your team and students.
Tip 5: Secure Funding Between Tiers
Use Phase 16 analytics to prove impact and secure more funding before starting Tier 3.
