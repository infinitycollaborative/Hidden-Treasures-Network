Step 5: Provide to Replit
Copy each value and paste into Replit:

🔒 SECURITY NOTE
IMPORTANT: These keys will be visible in your frontend code. This is normal and safe for Firebase because:

Firebase uses Security Rules to protect your data, not secret keys
The API key just identifies your project, it doesn't grant access
Access control happens in Firestore Security Rules

However, you should:

✅ Set up Firebase Security Rules (I've included these in all phase prompts)
✅ Enable App Check (optional but recommended for production)
✅ Set up billing alerts in Firebase


🛡️ SETTING UP SECURITY RULES
After adding your keys, go back to Firebase Console:
1. Firestore Security Rules

Go to Firestore Database (left sidebar)
Click Rules tab
Replace default rules with secure rules from your phase prompts

Example starter rules:
javascriptrules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper function to check if user is authenticated
    function isSignedIn() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Helper function to check user role
    function hasRole(role) {
      return isSignedIn() && 
             get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == role;
    }
    
    // Users collection - users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow write: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Students collection
    match /students/{studentId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow write: if hasRole('student') && request.auth.uid == studentId
                   || hasRole('mentor')
                   || hasRole('teacher')
                   || hasRole('platform_admin');
    }
    
    // More rules from your phase prompts...
  }
}
2. Storage Security Rules

Go to Storage (left sidebar)
Click Rules tab
Set up rules for file uploads

javascriptrules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /uploads/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

✅ AFTER ADDING KEYS TO REPLIT
Test Firebase Connection:

Test Authentication:

javascript// Should be in your code already
import { auth } from './firebase/config';
console.log('Firebase Auth:', auth.app.name); // Should log: "[DEFAULT]"

Test Firestore:

javascriptimport { db } from './firebase/config';
import { collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Try reading from a collection
const testConnection = async () => {
  try {
    const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'users'));
    console.log('Firestore connected! Documents:', snapshot.size);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Firestore error:', error);
  }
};

🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING
Error: "Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)"

❌ Wrong API key copied
✅ Go back to Firebase Console and copy the correct apiKey

Error: "Firebase: Error (auth/project-not-found)"

❌ Wrong Project ID
✅ Double-check projectId matches your Firebase project

Error: "Quota exceeded"

❌ Free tier limit reached
✅ Enable Firebase Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go, still very cheap)

Error: "Permission denied"

❌ Security rules too restrictive
✅ Check Firestore Security Rules tab
✅ Make sure rules allow authenticated users


🎯 RECOMMENDED FIREBASE SETUP
While you're in Firebase Console, also set up:
1. Enable Authentication Methods

Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
Enable:

✅ Email/Password
✅ Google (recommended)
✅ (Optional) Phone for SMS verification



2. Create Firestore Database

Go to Firestore Database
Click "Create database"
Choose Start in production mode (you'll add rules next)
Choose location closest to your users (e.g., us-east1 for East Coast)

3. Enable Storage

Go to Storage
Click "Get started"
Accept security rules (you'll customize later)

4. Enable Cloud Functions (for Phase 16 analytics)

Go to Functions (left sidebar)
Click "Get started"
Enable billing (Blaze plan) - free tier is generous


💰 FIREBASE PRICING (Don't Worry, It's Cheap!)
Free Tier (Spark Plan) Includes:

✅ Firestore: 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day
✅ Storage: 5GB
✅ Authentication: Unlimited
✅ Hosting: 10GB/month transfer

This is enough for:

100-500 active users
Thousands of students trying the platform
Your entire pilot program

When You Need to Upgrade (Blaze Plan):

Pay only for what you use beyond free tier
Typical costs at 1,000 users: $20-50/month
Typical costs at 10,000 users: $200-500/month


📝 SAVE YOUR KEYS SECURELY
Create a file called .env.local in your Replit project:
bashNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
Note: The NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix is required for Next.js to expose these to the browser.

✅ CHECKLIST
Before continuing with development:

 Firebase project created
 Web app registered
 All 6 config values copied to Replit
 Authentication enabled (Email/Password + Google)
 Firestore database created
 Storage enabled
 Security rules set up (basic rules first)
 Firebase connection tested (no errors in console)
 .env.local file created with keys


🚀 YOU'RE READY!
Once Replit has your Firebase keys, you can:

✅ Continue building your chosen phase
✅ Test authentication (user sign up/login)
✅ Test database (create/read data)
✅ Test file uploads (if using Storage)

The platform will now be connected to your Firebase backend!
